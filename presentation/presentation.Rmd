# Data manipulation

## working with columns in `j`

* select columns
```{r eval = FALSE}
## select columns month, day, and carrier
## dplyr
flight_tbl %>%
  select(month, day, carrier)
  
## data.table (the following three do the same thing)
# flight_dt[, list(month, day, carrier)]
# flight_dt[, c("month", "day", "carrier")]
flight_dt[, .(month, day, carrier)]
  
```

---

# Data manipulation

## working with columns in `j`

* `j` takes a list using `list()` or `.()`

* select columns

* drop columns
```{r eval = FALSE}
## drop columns month, day, and carrier
## dplyr (these two do the same)
flight_tbl %>%
  select(-month, -day, -carrier)

flight_tbl %>%
  select(!c(month, day, carrier))
  
## data.table
flight_dt[, !c("month", "day", "carrier")]

```

---

# Data manipulation

## working with columns in `j`

* `j` takes a list using `list()` or `.()`

* select columns

* drop columns

* rename columns
```{r eval = FALSE}
## rename dest to destination
## dplyr
flight_tbl %>%
  rename(destination = dest)

## data.table -- this will modify in place
setnames(flight_dt, "dest", "destination")

```

flight_dt[, month_day := NULL]

flight_dt[1:3]
```

---

# Data manipulation

## grouping with `by`

* by takes a list using `list()` or `.()`

* group by and summarise (does *not* modify in place)
--

```{r eval = F}
## calculate the mean dep_delay for carrier, origin, and dest
## dplyr
flight_tbl %>%
  group_by(carrier, origin, dest) %>%
  summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
## data.table -- this DOES NOT modify in place
## print first 3 rows
flight_dt[, .(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)), by = .(carrier, origin, dest)][1:3]

```

---

# Data manipulation

## grouping with `by`

* by takes a list using `list()` or `.()`

* group by and summarise (does *not* modify in place)

* group by and create a new column using `:=` (modifies in place)
--

```{r eval = F}
## calculate the mean dep_delay for carrier, origin, and dest
## dplyr
flight_tbl %>%
  group_by(carrier, origin, dest) %>%
  mutate(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  ungroup()
```
```{r}
## data.table -- this will modify in place
flight_dt[, mean_dep_delay := mean(dep_delay), by = .(carrier, origin, dest)]
flight_dt[1:2]
```

---

# Data manipulation

## helpful operators

* calculate the number of rows with `.N`
```{r eval = F}
## how many entries for each carrier?
## dplyr
flight_tbl %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  ungroup()
```
```{r}
## data.table -- this will not modify in place
flight_dt[, .N, by = carrier][1]
## compare with 
flight_dt[, n := .N, by = carrier][1]
```


---


# Data manipulation

## helpful operators

* calculate the number of rows with `.N`

* return count of unique values with `uniqueN`

* calculate on a subset of data with `.SD`

```{r}
## how many unique origin and dest locations by carrier?

## data.table -- this will not modify in place
flight_dt[, lapply(.SD, uniqueN), by = carrier, .SDcols = c("origin", "dest")][1:3]

--
* important implications for data manipulation

---

# Data manipulation

## chain

* similar to `%>%` in dplyr

* `[]`

--

```{r eval = FALSE}
## chain operations
## dplyr
    flight_dt %>%
      mutate(delay_diff = dep_delay - arr_delay,
             diff_over_at = delay_diff / air_time)

## data.table -- this will not modify in place
flight_dt[, delay_diff := dep_delay - arr_delay][, diff_over_at := delay_diff / air_time]

```

---

# Data manipulation

## joins

* use `merge()`

* full join: `all = TRUE`

* left join: `all.x = TRUE`

* right join: `all.y = TRUE`

---

# Data manipulation

## set keys
keys are like row names. setting keys...

* reorders the rows of a data.table by the key columns in increasing order

* makes lookups in key columns faster

* allows for merging without specifying merging columns

--
```{r}
## set keys on origin and dest
setkey(flight_dt, origin, dest)

key(flight_dt)

## subset on first key (origin), and then on second key (destination)
flight_dt[.("JFK", "MIA")][2]

```

---

# extra cool things

## running shell commands in ``fread()``

Let's say there's a zip file that has one CSV file inside. We can bypass the steps of downloading and unzipping it by using shell commands like ``curl`` and ``funzip`` directly in ``fread()``:

``fread("curl ftp://newftp.epa.gov/DMDnLoad/emissions/hourly/monthly/2019/2019ca01.zip | funzip")``

---

# random not-so-cool things

## no equivalent to `cross()` / `expand_grid`?
  
```{r }
df1 <- data.table(a = c(1986, 1990, 2014))
df2 <- data.table(b = c(1, 1, 2))

expand_grid(df1, df2)

```
