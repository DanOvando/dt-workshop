# Eco-data-science data.table workshop

## Workshop structure

We will begin the workshop with a presentation. The presentation includes examples of ``data.table`` and ``tidyverse`` coding chunks -- there is a ``follow-along.R`` script that allows you to run the code chunks along with the presentation.

Then, we will move into a hands-on coding session in an R notebook, where we will go through some examples of how we can analyze data using the ``data.table`` package.

## Requirements

This workshop will be focused on the R programming language, and there is an live coding component that takes place in an R notebook. If you would like to partake in the live coding, please have RStudio installed.

As for packages, you will need the following packages to follow along with the presentation and to participate in the live coding session:
  * `data.table`
  * `tidyverse`
  * `here`
  * `janitor`
  * `microbenchmark`
